The project contains a simple storage server, store.py, and client code to use the server, use_store.py.  The server requires that a user register.  Once registered, login.  The server can take files, download file content, list files, delete files, etc.

To use the code, download or clone the project.  In your local directory, using Python 3.6+, execute virtualenv <directory>. Execute 'source <your directory><virtual env>/bin/activate.  Install requried modules by executing pip install -r requirements.txt.  Execute python store.py to start the server.  Open another terminal window and cd to the directory and again source activate as above.  Execute the client code with python use_store.py.  The username and password usde for login are currently hard coded for ease.  As so many authors might say, I'll leave interactive login as an exercise for the reader.
